These are the notes for Week 3 Homework

The site I looked into is this: https://thepastaqueen.cooking/lets-cook/?srsltid=AfmBOorU6XVuirQTQTjdPPcyIXOGNSGrTvczXX8qZwQodDCCFF6lNG5W 

It has bunch of italian recipes of an italian chef Nadia Munno.

When I opened the site, apart from a lot of red color, I looked at the navigation bar. There are 6 pages- About, Show, Cooking Recipe, Shop, 
Membership (Royal Court). There is also a search bar. 

Under Shop, there is a drop down menu. 

The recipe page has images on the left and desciption and link to recipe on the right. 

The website is very colorful, and attractive overall.
